# Clothing Website with AI-Powered Virtual Try-On & Smart Sizing Recommendation System

## Project Statement
Many online clothing stores struggle with high return rates due to sizing issues and customersâ€™ inability to visualize how clothes will fit and look on them. This leads to customer dissatisfaction and increased operational costs.

## Project Solution
This project aims to develop an AI-powered Virtual Try-On & Smart Sizing Recommendation System that allows users to see how clothes will fit on their body type before purchasing. The system will use customer input measurements and a virtual fitting model to provide accurate size recommendations and a realistic try-on experience. It will also contain a cart and checkout section and a feedback section.
